# Canstar Frontend Test

## Task

This application currently contains boilerplate code for an Angular app. Your task is to add code to necessary files in order to display data consumed from a provided API in some 
meaningful way, this could be a list or table for example. 

The `products` directory has been created to contain the products component (how data will be displayed), and the `services` directory has been created to contain the code to 
consume the data (also includes the API endpoint).

## Development server 

In order to run this application you will need both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) installed locally.

Run `npm install` prior to running application for the first time.

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
